  # -- Inline skills --
  # skills defines Claude Code skills rendered as SKILL.md files and loaded via --add-dir.

  # -- Inline subagent files (markdown format) --
  # agentFiles defines markdown-format subagent definitions loaded via --add-dir.
  # These are mounted as .claude/agents/<name>.md files. Claude Code discovers
  # them and makes them available for delegation via the Task tool, and for
  # selection as the main agent via activeAgent or the MCP agent parameter.
  # Subagents defined here have lower priority than those in `agents` (JSON).
  # See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
  # Example:

  # -- Plugins --
  # plugins references Klaus plugins stored in OCI registries, delivered via
  # Kubernetes OCI image volumes (beta since Kubernetes 1.33, KEP-4639).
  # Each plugin is a versioned, distributable package of skills, hooks, agents,
  # and MCP servers. See giantswarm/klaus-operator#6 for the OCI artifact format.
  # Example:
  #   plugins:
  #     - repository: gsoci.azurecr.io/giantswarm/klaus-plugins/gs-base
  #       tag: v0.6.0

  # -- Subagents (JSON format, highest priority) --
  # agents defines custom subagents via the --agents CLI flag (JSON).
  # Subagents are specialized AI assistants that the main Claude Code agent
  # can delegate work to via the built-in "Task" tool. Each runs in its own
  # context window with its own prompt, tools, model, and permissions.
  # These have the highest priority and override agent files with the same name.
  # See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
  # Example:
  #   agents:
  #     reviewer:
  #       description: "Reviews code changes. Use proactively after edits."
  #       prompt: "You are a senior code reviewer..."
  #       tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
  #       model: "sonnet"
  #     deployer:
  #       description: "Handles deployments"
  #       prompt: "You are a deployment specialist..."
  agents: {}
  # activeAgent selects which agent runs as the top-level agent for the session

  # Enables progress tracking with message count, tool call count, and last activity.
  includePartialMessages: false
